            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a UX/UI Designer with a background in customer service and psychology. I studied psychology because of my strong desire to understand the human brain, behavior, and feelings. While studying, I also worked in sales for 5+ years to support myself and learned just how deeply I enjoy utilizing a strong empathy for others by tending to their needs.
              <br><b>Why did I transition to user experience?</b></br>
              For a long time, I wasn’t sure how to be creative, empathetic, and helpful to others in my career. Yet, I have always enjoyed learning about people and technology, and so I knew I wanted to build something on this.
              I’ve always appreciated products that are designed to be efficient and straightforward. From this, I recognized that UX Design could be the perfect intersection of my two passions.
              Today, I work to create better experiences for people. I design to improve others' lives through thoughtfully made products. And I aim to make decisions that add delight to the everyday.</p>
