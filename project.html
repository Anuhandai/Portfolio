        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <p>The request was for a mobile app that allows users to use cloud storage app or organizing app depending on the user's needs and market entry. Seeing potential in the cloud technology space, the client wanted a way to add the social aspect of sharing with friends as well.<br>
          <br>My task is to find out the user’s unique needs and wants through user research and discovery.
          <br><br>
          Additional requests were that this app allows users to:
          <br>

          • Save content you find on the web (links, images, videos, etc.)<br>
          • Organize content using categories, tags, groups, and/or
          folders<br>
          • Create content<br>
          • Upload files (videos, images, PDFs, etc.) from a computer or
          mobile device<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="problem">
        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <p>
          The Wale app is cloud storage for anybody who wants to see their wardrobe visually. It allows you to easily create outfits and get your friends’ opinions on your purchase or outfit choice. Best of all, everything is in the cloud.<br><br>
          Because people naturally forget things, Wale makes it easy for users to see their wardrobe at any time and gain inspiration from friends. Not only are users encouraged to make more conscious choices about their next purchase, but they can also get the most out of their more organized wardrobes.

    <div class="ur-callout">
      <div>
        <p>
          The survey users prefer the organizing cloud storage app that keeps only specific category items like furniture, cars, or clothes. Users prefer to see things visually, and users prefer easy to use features. They all use some organization apps like google, apps like Pinterest, and Instagram in their everyday lives.<br><br>
          Professional workers will have more income than students. Both users like to share their ideas with friends and love creativity. We found out that the majority of the users preferred the organizing app for specific items.<br><br>
          The solution was a wale app, a mobile app that easily allows users to create outfits by creating a wardrobe's visual database.<br><br>
          So we decided to go into the organization app for specific items. Everybody owns a cloth. It is hard sometimes to see what you have in your wardrobe since it's in the closet. It will help users see things visually and upload, save content, and organize it.<br><br>

        <p>Even though Pinterest and Instagram are not necessarily a cloud storage app, I looked into how often people use the social media app to share their outfit with their friends and save their pictures. In my user survey, I found out the most cloud storage and organization apps are Google drive, DropBox, and even Pinterest, and Instagram was among them.
          <br><br>None of the apps focused on saving specific category items; instead, it either keeps documents, and the content is too broad.

          <p>We did a usability test with three users. Users think the app is fun and straightforward. None of them mentioned if it was similar to any other apps. They all love the idea of visually seeing their wardrobe idea. Most importantly, they are excited about how they can interact with friends and other users. One of the users thought of how one dress is essential for expressing themself. All users find it useful. They all liked it because it can interact with other users rather than just seeing your wardrobe. One user found the Wale feature interesting; the voting for choosing an outfit option to a friend was unique and fun.
            <br><br>They would like to see more features that include connecting to different social media or stores. Giving people options to upload pictures already would be a better user experience; instead, users upload images one by one. Also, in the future, if we can estimate the user's wardrobe by calculating the estimation, privately, users would be a fun way to attract users.
