  <h2 class = "title">About Me</h2>
  <div class = "about-me">

    <p>I am a UX/UI Designer with a background in customer service and psychology. I studied psychology because of my strong desire to understand the human brain, behavior, and feelings. While studying, I also worked in sales for 5+ years to support myself and learned just how deeply I enjoy utilizing a strong empathy for others by tending to their needs. <br/><br/>
      <b>Why did I transition to user experience? </b>
      <br/><br/>
      For a long time, I wasn’t sure how to be creative, empathetic, and helpful to others in my career. Yet, I have always enjoyed learning about people and technology, and so I knew I wanted to build something on this.
      I’ve always appreciated products that are designed to be efficient and straightforward. From this, I recognized that UX Design could be the perfect intersection of my two passions.
      Today, I work to create better experiences for people. I design to improve others' lives through thoughtfully made products. And I aim to make decisions that add delight to the everyday.

            Anuka is hardworking and understands how the day-to-day and big picture both play a key role in the success of the business. She seeks out company culture and quickly integrates new initiatives into the way she approaches her work. Anuka asks insightful questions to ensure she has a thorough understanding of what is asked of her. I know that when I train her on a new skill she will execute every step with precision.
